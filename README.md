It highlights her technical expertise, academic background, and personal projects in a clean, modern format that mimics real-world developer portfolios used by professionals globally.
The project aims to represent the developer‚Äôs capabilities and passion for web development in a simple yet visually attractive format.

VS Code: The primary code editor used for writing, debugging, and previewing code during development.

Each page maintains design consistency and is connected using semantic hyperlinks and a minimalist user interface.

Academic Submissions: Meets the criteria for college-level project assignments in frontend or web development.

Freelancing Profiles: Useful for showcasing a clean personal brand on platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, or Behance.

Local Preview with Live Server ‚Äì Ideal during development and testing phases.

üí¨ Final Thoughts:
